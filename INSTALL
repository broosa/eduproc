EduProc Install Instructions

-------------------------------------------------

NOTE: This software is in very early stages; the build may and very likely will change often.

---- Build Prerequisites ----

  * a recent version of GCC
  * libc standard libraries
  * GNU make
  * git (if you want to stay up to date with the bleeding edge)

---- Downloading the source code ----

Make sure you have a local copy of the repository

 $ git clone http://github.com/violinuxer/eduproc

This will download the latest source code a subdirectory of your current working directory

Change into this new directory:

 $ cd eduproc

Run make to build the main binary:

 $ make

or

 $ make release

This generates the main executable: main.out. You can execute the following command to
run the software:

 $ ./main.out

---- Staying Up to Date ----

To get the latest version of the source code, execute a git pull:

 $ git pull

This will download any changes from the remote repository and update your local copy
to the latest version.
