# About

EduProc is an educational microprocessor arcitecture and emulator for learning
computer organization and computer engineering. The main goal of the project
so far is to create an easy-to-understand instruction set and executable
specification that can be used in an educational setting to learn and teach
the concepts behind low level computer programming and engineering.

## Current Features

 * Very basic memory space emulation
 * Main executable contains basic memory monitor with memory read, write, and
   dump functions

## Planned Features

 * RISC-like Architecture
   - 32 bit memory addressing
   - Fixed width 64 bit instructions
   - 16 arithmetic registers
 * May be user-designable/configurable
 * Interrupts (timer, simulated io, software, etc)
 * Simulated DMA, UART
 * Also will include debugger, assembler

There also is a PDF in docs folder for an initial basic instruction layout.

# Getting Started

For instructions on how to build the software, see the INSTALL file. More
information will be forthcoming as the software matures.
