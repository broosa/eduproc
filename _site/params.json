{"name":"Eduproc","tagline":"A simple microprocessor design for teaching computer organization","body":"# About\r\n\r\nEduProc is an educational microprocessor arcitecture and emulator for learning\r\ncomputer organization and computer engineering. The main goal of the project\r\nso far is to create an easy-to-understand instruction set and executable\r\nspecification that can be used in an educational setting to learn and teach\r\nthe concepts behind low level computer programming and engineering.\r\n\r\n## Current Features\r\n\r\n * Very basic memory space emulation\r\n * Main executable contains basic memory monitor with memory read, write, and\r\n   dump functions\r\n\r\n## Planned Features\r\n\r\n * RISC-like Architecture\r\n   - 32 bit memory addressing\r\n   - Fixed width 64 bit instructions\r\n   - 16 arithmetic registers\r\n * May be user-designable/configurable\r\n * Interrupts (timer, simulated io, software, etc)\r\n * Simulated DMA, UART\r\n * Also will include debugger, assembler\r\n\r\nThere also is a PDF in docs folder for an initial basic instruction layout.\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\n\r\nFor instructions on how to build the software, see the INSTALL file. More\r\ninformation will be forthcoming as the software matures.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
